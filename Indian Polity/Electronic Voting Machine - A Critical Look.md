Why Electronic Voting Machine warrants  a critical examination.
The recent (2024) Supreme Court verdict regarding vvpat counting is a bad system design. The court wants us to essentially just believe Election Commission and not asks question. This is a blow to transparency in the election process.

The best course of action i believe is for the EC to publish the result from the EVM as a draft/ interim result as usual and only after counting the VVPATs and tallying it with the EVM counts proclaim the result as official.

This process essentially makes the elections transparent, as the process is transparent. No just believe me bullshit. Everything is verifiable and audit able.
