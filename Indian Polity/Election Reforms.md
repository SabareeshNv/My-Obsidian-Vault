how election reforms /  electoral reforms can solve some of the worst aspect of Indian polity.
Discuss how the urge for electoral winning contribute to the perverse incentives for politicians. This ties to [[Need to Reform Indian Politics]]

Many people rightly consider that current electoral system in the country as the basis for the current high level of political corruption. The incentives of the politicians do not align with peoples wishes. Why is that. How can it be changed 
[[Politicians incentives do not align with the peoples wishes]]


A country cannot be called truly democratic until its citizens have the opportunity to choose their representative through elections that are free and fair.

The electoral system is the political institution that shapes the behaviour of key players in a democracy. Therefore, the electoral system plays an important role in the survival as well as the revival of the democracy, as it translates votes into seats, which become the basis for government formation.

As the electoral system translates votes into seats, it affects the formation of parties, the nature of government, and the behaviour of voters. The electoral system consists of factors like the electoral formula used for electing the representatives, ballot structure, and the number of representatives elected. These factors decide who will run the government, and how power will be transferred from one government to the next. Therefore, the electoral system has an important role in “meaningful election” as well as post-election government formation and governance. What is a meaningful election? Reynolds, Reilly and Ellis (2008) suggest that for a meaningful election, the elected representatives should have a role in the formation of the government as well as in the policy formation.

# How my idea differs from current set of reforms proposed

How is the reforms envisaged by me differs from the reforms proposed by election commission or other mainstream parties / medias

When it comes to election reforms, the advocates usually are concerned with some details of the process. Some of these are - trying to make it easier to vote, secure the voting process, and ensure voting is transparent. Another is money in politics—working to make political spending transparent and prevent it from corruptly influencing elected officials.

All of these issues are critically important. Democracy means little without the right to vote, and it is at least compromised if money or muscle power drive political outcomes.

However there is another fundamental issue that deserve our attention. That issue is electoral reform—examining the most basic rules of the political system and finding ways to ensure that they are promoting effective, representative government. The electoral system is the set of rules that determines how representatives are selected: which candidates and political parties can compete in the election, who those candidates and parties represent, and how voters are allowed to choose between them. These rules shape the makeup of the Parliament and State legislatures as well the local bodies, and they create strong incentives that guide the behaviour of elected officials.



# Is there a constitutional or legal change required for the necessary reforms?

Need to research into it.
