# What is First Past The Post
FPTP is viewed as the simplest form of the electoral system, as each voter can give only one vote, and the candidate with the highest number of votes wins, even if they do not have the absolute majority in the constituency

# Disadvantages of FPTP

- FPTP does have disadvantages. FPTP favours major parties, and can exclude small and regional parties, which means the FPTP system tends to create a single party which forms the government
- FPTP also creates a discrepancy between the vote share obtained by the parties and the seat share they win. Taagepera and Shugart (1989) also suggests that the FPTP suffers from the problem of ‘overamplification’, which is when a small shift in vote share can generate drastic changes in seat share.Overamplification can be seen as a biproduct of disproportionality, in that disproportionality means that a candidate with a small vote share can manage to win, and hence a small change in vote share can change that result.
- In terms of preferences, voters may not vote for optimal preference in the FPTP system, in order to avoid ‘wastage’ of their vote. Such behaviour by voters creates a problem for small parties. As far as Indian democracy is concerned, despite the FPTP system being implemented, small and regional parties are well-established and continue to survive – an exception to Monroe’s conclusions. But Indian democracy does witness the discrepancy between vote share and seat share.
- The plurality rule tends to produce a two-party system. India, on the contrary, has a multiparty system – albeit with high level of dis-proportionality, where one party tends to emerge as dominant after votes are translated into seats


# Why not Proportional Reprosentation

The PR system reduces the disproportionality (Gallagher (1991), Powell and Vanberg (2000)). On the other hand, due to many parties,  PR system can witness instability. Taagepera and Shugart (1989), however, suggest that over a
period of time PR system will not be unstable, and a plural system will not remain unrepresentative.

A stable government with efficient representation can be the best combination for any democracy, wherein votes are getting translated into representation in the house, and a relatively large share of the representatives are involved with governing the state.


# Why Approval Voting
Democracie s around the world have witnessed the evolution of the electoral system and institutions. For India too, the electoral system should evolve, and if possible then alternatives for FPTP should be investigated again -- not just to
correct the disproportionality, but also to ensure fair participation of the political parties in governance.
